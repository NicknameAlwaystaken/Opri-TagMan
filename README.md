# What is TagMan?

**Welcome to TagMan!**

TagMan is a game of finding words by guessing one letter at a time. Each time you play you get a new word. Guessing correct letters fill the answer with the correct guesses and with wrong guesses you will lose lives.
If you run out of lives before finishing filling up the answer you will lose.
